          <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong>   <p>You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? Not all treasure is silver and gold Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. But I am touched by y’loyalty mate. Without the messy paperwork.</p>
            <p>Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. That’s some treasure chest you’ve got there. There comes a time in most men’s lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. Why are pirates pirates? cuz they arrrrrr you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. The average man will bristle if you say his father was dishonest, but he will brag a little if he discovers that his great- grandfather was a pirate. Shiver me timbers.</p>
